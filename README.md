# Telemetry Intelligence Platform

## Problem Statement
Engineering teams collect massive telemetry data, but when failures occur they rely on manual queries and tribal knowledge to debug issues. Existing platforms store telemetry reliably but do not structure it in a way that makes historical debugging, trend analysis, or data-driven and ML-assisted investigation fast, cost-efficient, and accessible at scale.

## Target Users

## High-Level Architecture
Batch and streaming telemetry ingestion into a lakehouse architecture,
optimized for historical analysis and ML-assisted querying.
